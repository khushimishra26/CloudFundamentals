# CloudFundamentals
This documents beginning to my cloud journey. Some hands-on activities I performed on AWS are mentioned below. I have tried to touch upon my learnings in brief:
By Performing these tasks I learned (still learning :p) about many AWS core services like:

AWS Simple Storage Service (S3): I learned the end-to-end process of web-hosting, by deploying a static website on the cloud, using S3. I also used a custom domain which I configured using AWS Route53. I also defined the bucket policy and set the ACL to control access to specific elements in my storage.

AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): I practiced hosting a web application on the cloud. I configured an EC2 instance, installed various softwares like java, maven, git and tomcat server on the same instance. Finally I installed my application on the server and configured the app to be accessible via the internet, by setting inbound rules. I also used a termination protection to avoid accidental/malefic deletion of my instance.
